		<h1 style="color:Red">History of Shivaji</h1>
		<p>Shivaji Raje Bhosle, with the royal title Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj , was a Maratha aristocrat of the Bhosle clan who founded the Maratha empire. Shivaji led a resistance to free the Maratha kingdom from the Sultanate of Bijapur, and establish Hindavi Swarajya ("self-rule of Hindu people"). He created an independent Maratha kingdom with Vedant Raigad as its capital, and successfully fought against the Mughals to defend his kingdom. He was crowned as Chhatrapati ("sovereign") of the Maratha kingdom in 1674.</p>
